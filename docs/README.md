# E-Commerce Analytics – Documentation

This folder contains documentation related to the analytics layer built on top
of the Brazilian e-commerce dataset.

## Scope

- Snowflake used as the analytics warehouse

## Dataset
Historical e-commerce data from 2016–2018.

## Key KPIs

Real-time ingestion is intentionally out of scope.
