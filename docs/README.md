# E-Commerce Data Pipeline & Analytics (Snowflake + dbt)

This repository showcases an end-to-end analytics engineering workflow built on Snowflake and dbt. 
The project focuses on transforming raw e-commerce data into well-modeled fact and dimension tables, 
and deriving executive-ready revenue and growth KPIs through SQL-based analytics views and dashboards.

The emphasis of this project is on analytics design, semantic modeling, and business-aligned metrics, 
not on real-time ingestion or streaming infrastructure.

# E-Commerce Analytics – Documentation

This folder contains documentation related to the analytics layer built on top
of the Brazilian e-commerce dataset.

## Scope
- Analytics engineering using dbt
- Revenue KPIs modeled in SQL
- Snowflake used as the analytics warehouse

## Dataset
Historical e-commerce data from 2016–2018.

## Key KPIs
- Monthly Revenue (USD)
- Month-over-Month Revenue Growth (%)

## Design Philosophy
The project focuses on:
- Correct data modeling
- Business-aligned metrics
